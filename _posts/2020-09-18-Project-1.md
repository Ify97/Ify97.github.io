For this project, I created a vignette that explains how to access data from the NHL records and NHL stats APIs. I used plots, contingency tables, and quantitative summaries to explore the data. 

+ I observed that 1967 was the year in which the most games were played.
+ More games were played during the last 50 years
+ The Montreal Canandiens performed better.

As I reflect on this project, here are the things I hope to change in the future;
    * I underestimated the time required for this project. For instance, I started working on this project the day before it was due. As a result of this, I had to do the whole exploratory data analysis section in one sitting. In the future, I hope to start my project as soon as possible without procastinating.
    * The most difficult part was understanding the project instructions. I thought this was a question and answer type of project. When I actually realized it was the opposite of that, it was too late.
    * I also experienced difficulty interacting with the APIs. When I figured what a modifier actually was, I became more comfortable with it.
    * For my next project, I hope to start working on it on time. I know I would have done better in my analysis and insights if I had extra time.
