  Being a Data Scientist is about analyzing large amounts of data for actionable insights. It deals with extracting structured, unstructured, and messy data, as well as cleaning and transforming data inorder to identify patterns and trends. 
  
  A Data Scientist spends majority of their time cleaning data. Their main duties entails; extracting and transforming data, exploring and visualizing the data for analysis.
  
  Data Scientists and Statisticians both tend to collect data, analyze data, and make inferences from the data. However, Data Scientists deals with a larger amount of data, often more messy than Statisticians. This requires Data Scientists to spend most of their time cleaning data. Statisticians focuses more on survey data, polls, and experiments. 
  
  I believe I would be better suited to a career as a Statistician rather than a Data Scientist due to my stong foundation in Statistics and Mathematics. A Data science career would be well suited for someone with a strong foundation in computer science.
