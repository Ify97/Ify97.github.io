Being a Data Scientist is about analyzing copious amounts of data for actionable insights. It deals with extracting data unstructured and messy data, cleaning the 
data and transforming it inorder to help a business make better decisions. 

The major duties of a data scientist includes; Data Collection, Data analysis, Data transformation and manipulation.

The similarities between data scientists and statisticians is that they both tend to tend to collect and analyze data, and make claims about data. On the other hand
data scientists deals with a large amount of data often more messy than statisticians, this requires them to spend more of their time cleaning and transforming data. Statisticians focus more on survey data, polls, and experiments. 

I believe I would be better suited to a job as a Statistician rather than a Data Scientist. A data scientist is meant to have a strong foundation of the main programming languages. I have a weak foundation in computer Programming languages such as python, C+, and Java but a stronger foundation in statistical programming languages such as SAS and R.
