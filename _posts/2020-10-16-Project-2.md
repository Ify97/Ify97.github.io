title: Bike Share Analysis
---
Here is the link to my project: https://ifyojialor.github.io/project2


For this project, I used a regression tree and boosted tree models to predict the count of bikes used in a bike sharing system. 
I performed exploratory data analysis on all the variables, this gave me a good idea of the variables that were relevant to the model. Some variables 
were log-transformed due to evidence of skewness. At the end, I was able to choose the best model to make good predictions on the total count of bikes. This report 
was also automated using the weekday parameter.

A few points;

I`m not sure what I would have done differently. I tried not to procrastinate and started the project a few days before the due date. 
This project ran moresmoothly than the first project other than some minor errors.

The most difficult part for me was the automation. I wasnt sure if the automation code should be in the same document or in a separate R script. Took me a while 
to figure this out.

My takeawys for this project are;
Boosted tree models is one of the best models for predictive analytics.
Exploratory Data Analysis is very important before building models.
