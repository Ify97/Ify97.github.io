Looking back at my original post, I mentioned that the main duties of a Data Scientist entails; extracting and transforming data, exploring and visualizing the data for analysis. I believe programming with R is a beneficial aspect of data science career because of the fascinating data science packages R brings. Data scientists need to have an advanced statistical background inorder to be successful.

I love the community and packages R provides. Moving forward, I will continue to use R. I found R easier to understand and troubleshoot because of its large community.

This course has expanded my data analysis and programming knowledge. Moving forward, I can apply the skills learned from this course to my other statistics courses.
I still wish to become a Statistician other than a Data scientist.
