I believe R is the best language for data science. Compared to SAS, R is better for Statistical analysis and data manipulation due to its numerous packages and wide range of functions. R offers inbuilt mechanisms for organizing data, running calculations on the given information and creating graphical representations of that data sets.
The thing I miss about SAS is that it has functions that are easier to learn and has great technical support. Although, R is a more difficult language to learn compared to SAS, the add-on packages and free resources available online makes it easier to learn.
